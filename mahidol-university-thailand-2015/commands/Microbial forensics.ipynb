The Unweighted UniFrac Emperor plots (linked from the ``core_diversity_analyses.py`` ``index.html`` file) will allow you to figure out which subject (`M2`, `M3`, or `M9`) touched which keyboard (`K1`, `K2`, or `K3`). Match the individuals to the keyboard they touched, and explain how you came to this answer. There is one right answer to this question."
